      <description>In episode 76 of the freelance transformation podcast Matt interviews Laura, a freelance solo designer that works entirely remotely.
There are a lot of good tips spread across the interview, but here&amp;rsquo;s my favourites:
 Send new clients a Starbucks/Costa/Caf√© gift card. Try to guest post in blogs where your target market hangs out. Note that these are probably different from the ones where you hang out. Use copy that connects in your website.</description>
