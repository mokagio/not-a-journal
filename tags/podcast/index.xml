      <description>Episode 216 of &amp;ldquo;The Freelancers&amp;rsquo; Show&amp;rdquo; has a great and original conversation on automation.
Unlike many other posts and podcasts on the topic, this one focus on how to find out what to automate, and why you should -or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t- automate something.</description>

      <description>In an otherwise usual conversation about Agile-slash-Scrum which tells the same old story, Matt -the host- mentioned the carpentry rule:
 Measure Twice, Cut Once
 I think that&amp;rsquo;s a quite cool rule, and I shall keep it close to my heart.
I am a software developer to the core. My ideal work day is composed of only coding, no meeting, no emails, only code.
I am aware though that &amp;ldquo;just coding&amp;rdquo; or start coding without a plan can be, and most likely will be, counter productive.</description>

      <description>In episode 76 of the freelance transformation podcast Matt interviews Laura, a freelance solo designer that works entirely remotely.
There are a lot of good tips spread across the interview, but here&amp;rsquo;s my favourites:
 Send new clients a Starbucks/Costa/Caf√© gift card. Try to guest post in blogs where your target market hangs out. Note that these are probably different from the ones where you hang out. Use copy that connects in your website.</description>
