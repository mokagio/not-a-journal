In [episode 76 of the freelance transformation
podcast](https://freelancetransformation.com/blog/find-and-work-with-clients-remotely-with-laura-elizabeth)
Matt interviews Laura, a freelance solo designer that works entirely remotely.

There are a lot of good tips spread across the interview, but here's my
favourites:

- Send new clients a Starbucks/Costa/Caf√© gift card.
- Try to guest post in blogs where your target market hangs out. _Note that these are probably different from the ones where you hang out._
- Use copy that connects in your website. One of her landing page says "Websites as beautiful as the code behind them".
- Ask for referrals.
- https://calendly.com/
- Have a "client zone" where all the deliverables and the status updates for the client are stored, so that they can acces it without calling you. Helps a lot with different time zones. Could be as simple as a Dropbox folder.
