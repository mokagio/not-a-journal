[Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations) are the
11th equations of the book "[In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That
Changed the
World](https://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Equations-That-Changed-World/dp/0465085989)".

Let's brush over the fact that I have completely forgotten how to handle the mathematics needed to manipulated them from Uni, and talk about some cool things.

I like how Maxwell derived his equations from the many experiments and machines built by [Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday). It's like he polished Faraday's work, or better removed the inessential part and uncovered the shiny mathematical laws that made it possible.

It's also fascinating how these four equations are the first ones to unify two forces of nature. They proved how electricity and magnetism are actually two sides of the same coin: the electromagnetical force.

Finally, the realization that light behaves like a wave, and that it's spectrum is way wider that visible plus ultraviolet and infrared, and the new series of discoveries and inventions it produced is inspiring.
