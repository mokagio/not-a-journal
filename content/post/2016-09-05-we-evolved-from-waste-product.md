In a recent episode of Stuff To Blow Your Mind titled "[Saturn's Brood: Beyond
the Outer
Ring](http://www.stufftoblowyourmind.com/podcasts/saturns-brood-beyond-the-outer-ring.htm)"
the host talked about some of Saturn's moons.

One of the moons is [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)). One of
the ways to look for proof of life on its surface is to look for signs of
[atmospheric engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering).
This concept got introduced making a parallel with Earth:

> Our atmosphere is not 21% Oxygen because of the physics of planetary
> formation. That wasn't like that when Earth was formed. It is 21% Oxygen
> because it is full of creatures, organisms that change the atmosphere of our
> planet. [Oxygen] is their waste product, their poop, their breathing out,
> however you want to phrase it. They take in sunlight and CO2, they use the
> energy from the sunlight to split up the CO2, make body part out of the
> Carbon at then spit out the Oxygen as a waste product. And so you could look
> at the original oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere as this mass poisoning
> event. We just happen to be the kind of animals that evolved to thrive amidst
> this mass poisoning and to work well with it.

This way to look at how life started on Earth and ultimately resulted in human
being was new to me. I find it fascinating and very **humbling**.

We are nothing but creatures that evolved by feeding of the waste product of
other creatures.
