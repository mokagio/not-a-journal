[Episode 216](https://devchat.tv/freelancers/216-fs-automation) of "The
Freelancers' Show" has a great and original conversation on automation.

Unlike many other posts and podcasts on the topic, this one focus on how to
find out what to automate, and why you should -or shouldn't- automate
something.
