In an otherwise usual conversation about Agile-slash-Scrum which tells the same
old story, Matt -the host- mentioned the carpentry rule:

> Measure Twice, Cut Once

I think that's a quite cool rule, and I shall keep it close to my heart.

I am a software developer to the core. My ideal work day is composed of only
coding, no meeting, no emails, only code.

I am aware though that "just coding" or start coding without a plan can be, and
most likely will be, counter productive.

I shall keep the catchy "_Measure Twice, Cut Once_" rule close to heart to
remind myself that yes, estimations sucks, but at least having a plan an being
able to prioritize what to work on is useful and will make coding easier.
