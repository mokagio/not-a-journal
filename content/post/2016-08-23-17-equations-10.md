+++

The [Navier-Stokes
equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) is the
10th equation of the book "[In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That
Changed the
World](https://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Equations-That-Changed-World/dp/0465085989)".

This equation relates the acceleration of a small region of fluid with the
forces that act on it.

The fact that this equation is at the base of the mathematical models used to
design airplanes already makes it interesting, but what I found fascinating are
its application to the study of how blood flows in our veins and arteries, and
"climate change".

The fact that researchers are developing models in the attempt of understanding
the flow of oceans and atmosphere on our planets using a 3-dimensional grid and
applying a version of the Navies-Stokes equation to it is super cool.
