title = "Using a Mental Model to Keep Sanity Through Hardships"

+++

In chapter 11 of "[Creativity
Inc.](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012)"
author [Ed Catmull](https://twitter.com/edcatmull?lang=en) talks about...

Something he touches towards the end of the chapter is how Pixar's producers,
directors, and others have their own mental models of what the process of
making a movie looks like.

I found this chapter very interesting. So far I had only seen mental models as
a tool that software developer like me use to understand the system they need
to implement, or abstract concepts they rely on.

I had never though of them as a tool to help ourselves keeping our sanity when
going through a hard time, or to guide us in creative activities like making
something out of nothing, in which sometimes it's possible to get lost or lose
momentum.
