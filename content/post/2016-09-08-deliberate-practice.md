The podcast [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) recently released a two part series on deliberate
practice ([part 1](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/45636) and [part 2](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/45637)).

I first read about deliberate practice in "[So Good They Can't Ignore
You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124)" by Cal
Newport.

The concept is very attractive, and it has been proven very effective for
athletes and musicians. But how can I build a deliberate practice strategy for
my software development skills?

Does it even make sense?

It probably does, but only for a subset of things I guess. For example:

- Vim/Emacs skills
- Refactoring techniques
- Using patterns

I thinks all those are valuable, I myself am very serious about touch-typing
and shaving off keystrokes from my Vim workflows, but do they really make you a
_better_ developer?

I think the real skills that a software developer should hone are problem
solving and the ability to learn new things.

That is why I guess I am less interested into deliberate practice as a way to
write code faster, but more as way to improve these _lower level_ skills.

I don't have a recipe for deliberately practicing problem solving or learning.
At the moment these are only two guidelines I have:

- Try to solve a little logic puzzle every day
- When choosing a book to read, a new programming language or framework, anything new to learn, choose things that will grow your _area of knowledge_
