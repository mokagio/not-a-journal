<p>These are my rather unorganized notes from &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31553806-peak">Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise</a>&rdquo; by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool.</p>

<p>Take everything with a pinch of salt. They are what I found useful and worth highlighting from the book. Their density depends in part by the state of mind in which I was when reading or listening. Some times I write a lot of notes, other times less.</p>

<p>The very first part of these notes is written from memory, after finishing the book. I wrote the notes for that part on paper, but the bag where I left then got stolen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I remember of the notes that got stolen from me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The human body and brains are incredibly versatile and adaptable. The book shows many examples of how the brain can remodel itself when put under serious and prolonged training. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity">neuroplasiticity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">Homeostasis</a> is the state of equilibrium of the body. Practice and training are effective if they challenge homeostasis.</p>

<p>Challenging homeostasis results in the body adapting to the challenge, making the next state the norm. E.g. running 3k every morning will result in the body adapting to that. For training to be effective then the body needs to be challenged again, running more ks, or the same distance but faster.</p>

<p>Our everyday lives do very little to challenge our brain to create new gray matter. Traditional learning doesn&rsquo;t challenge homeostatis either. We &ldquo;live in the land of good enough&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The different kind of ways in which people practice at something are inspected to see how they challenge homeostasis.</p>

<p>This part introduces the concept of Purposeful Practice. That is, practicing focusing on improving a certain area of the skill.</p>

<p>Purposeful Practice is a great way to challenge homeostasis and improve, but is not enough. What the rest of the book will cover is a better version of Purposeful Practice, Deliberate Practice.</p>

<p>Now for the actual notes&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="mental-representations">Mental Representations</h2>

<p>Many chess grand masters are able to play blindfold chess. That&rsquo;s because the mental abilities to do one are a byproduct of the other.</p>

<p>Chess masters seem to be able to remember boards as soon as they see it. That&rsquo;s because they see patterns in the board, not the actual pieces. This taps in the long term memory, not short term. When playing blindfold they don&rsquo;t remember the entire board, but rather the patterns in it.</p>

<p>These mental representation allow the chess masters to view the board&rsquo;s status, that is, who&rsquo;s winning, but also drill onto the single pieces. This allows them to move single pieces in their mind, to see how the patterns would change and make the best move.</p>

<p><em>Patterns carry meaning.</em></p>

<p>Remembering a painting is an example of mental representation. Words themselves are tools to recall mental representation of what they encode.</p>

<p>Mental representations are domain specific. They only work for the skill they apply to. E.g. chess masters being as good as novice at remembering random boards that where not set for games.</p>

<p>Mental representations make it possible to process information fast. They allow to bypass the limits of short term memory.</p>

<p>What sets experts apart is the quality and quantity of their mental representations. The purpose of deliberate practice is to produces and refine advanced mental representations.</p>

<p>Mental representations help making sense of informations. Having a base knowledge of something, that is, a few mental representations, allows one to understand further information about the subject.</p>

<p>For this reason it is actually good to read more than one book on the same topic if you want to develop a good understanding. Or even read the same book after a period of time.</p>

<p>Example of the expert doctors making diagnosis. The value of their advanced mental representations is that they can absorb a lot of information at one and consider different options.</p>

<p>Superior organization of information is a trait of expert performers.</p>

<p>The ability to planning ahead is another trait of top performers. E.g. Expert rock climbers plan the climb when looking at a wall.</p>

<p>The better the mental representations, the better the planning.</p>

<p><em>Personal note: that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been preaching to my software development team mates. Learn to make a plan!</em></p>

<p><em>This also reminded me of Michael Phelps&rsquo; &ldquo;video tape&rdquo; story from &ldquo;The Power of Habits&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>The more effective the mental representations, the better the performance. To improve performance you use feedback to refine the mental representations. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Note that physical activities are mental too. E.g. mental representation of a swim stroke.</p>

<p>Mental representations are &ldquo;like a staircase that you climb as you build it&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="deliberate-practice">Deliberate Practice</h2>

<p>A Deliberate Practice routine can be developed only for established fields. Fields where these conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear metric for performance.</li>
<li>Competitive, so there&rsquo;s incentive to training.</li>
<li>With decades or even centuries of history, so best practices have emerged.</li>
<li>With a subset of practicioners being coaches as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many experiments have proven that there is no other way to reach the level of top performer than to practice, a lot, and in the proper way.</p>

<p><em>Deliberate Practice is defined in details in the middle of chapter 5 of the audiobook</em>.</p>

<p>Skills are cumulative. Advanced skills build on top of the more basic ones. For this reason it is important to learn the basics well and early. A good coach knows this.</p>

<p>Because of its definition only a few disciplines can have &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Deliberate Practice. We can still apply it’s principles in other disciplines though.</p>

<p>E.g. Memory athletes don’t have teachers and the field is not established, but they can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use top performer scores as a metric to measure their level.</li>
<li>Use the experience of previous athletes to develop their own practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying top performers is hard. One needs to be careful with the many biases that influence human judgement. Best to look for objective measurements. In lack of those, try to ask to people that are in touch with many possible experts in many different contexts. E.g. nurses that work in different units can give better judgment on the doctors&rsquo; performance.</p>

<p>Note that it’s proven that things like seniority and years of experience are not an guarantee for top performance.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the 10k rule is not a rule. The journalist that made it famous misunderstood, or decided to misunderstand it, as journalist often do when it comes to science.</p>

<h2 id="deliberate-practice-on-the-job">Deliberate Practice on the job.</h2>

<p>Many studies done on doctors to verify whether performance improves with seniority have show a clear result. There is little connection between skills and seniority. Only practice improves skills in a relevant way.</p>

<p>It also seems that going to lecture and conferences with only talks doesn’t contribute to improving doctors performance.</p>

<p>There’s a little section on the difference between skill and knowledge, and what felt to me like a critique to the current school and academic world. Needless to say it resonated a lot.</p>

<p>The following section details doctors training sessions inspired by Deliberate Practice. It’s a good source of inspiration on how to apply the principles to design a practice routine. <em>More will come towards the end of the book.</em></p>

<p><strong>Recap:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Practice is way more effective that gathering knowledge at improving performance.</li>
<li>Getting feedback on the performance is the first step to improve.</li>
<li>It’s important to find top performers, and find out what they do that separates them from the rest.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliberate-practice-for-normal-people">Deliberate Practice for “normal people”</h2>

<p>The first and most important thing to do to improve is to find a teacher.</p>

<p>A good teacher needs to be accomplished in the field, and to have a track record of teaching experience.</p>

<p>As one improves it is possible they&rsquo;ll need a new teacher. That&rsquo;s ok.</p>

<p>It’s also important to have one on one sessions. Group sessions are good to get started, but can&rsquo;t provide the depth and individual focus required for real Deliberate Practice.</p>

<p>When performing Deliberate Practice, quality is more important than quantity.</p>

<p>It is mandatory to stay focused. Example: US swimmer Natalie Coughlin started to get great results once she understood how to focus on her technique during the training sessions.</p>

<p>Prolonged focus is hard, _a lot more on the topic can be found in &ldquo;Deep Work&rdquo;. When starting Deliberate Practice it’s better to have short session of maintained focuse, rather than standard duration ones in which focus is lost.</p>

<p>Deliberate Practice should not be fun. Or rather should not be <em>just</em> fun.</p>

<p>The level of focus required, and the fact that one should operate outside of their comfort zone, means that the practice should end up being tiring. Examples: violin players not particularly enjoying all the drills, and often needing an afternoon nap. Expert singer that didn’t feel elated after their lessons in a comparison study with beginner.</p>

<p>The book provides more tips on how to find and work with a teacher. After that it moves on suggestions on how to develop Deliberate and Purposeful Practice exercises if a teacher is not available.</p>

<p>A little framework to develop a practice routine is introduced as the 3 Fs.   Focus,  Feedback,  Fix it.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Break the skill down into components that can be done repeatedly.</li>
<li>Analyse the performance.</li>
<li>Fix the issues found in there.</li>
</ul>

<p>  Benjamin Franklin writing exercises are a great example of the 3 Fs.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-surpass-plateaus">How to surpass plateaus</h3>

<p>It is common when learning new skills to reach a plateau. It can be tempting to think that is the top level that one can achieve, but that is unlikely.</p>

<p>Any skill is made up of basic components, and usually it is one of those that is holding down the improvement. The way to getting over a plateau is to identify the basic component that is holding one down, then work to improve it.</p>

<p>Example: typing exercises.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Again, the idea that top performers have special talents is nonsense. Same goes for the idea that they have more willpower than other people, and so can go through the many hours of practice required.</p>

<p>There is no scientific proof that talent exists. No “chess master gene” has ever been discovered.</p>

<p>Instead, what actually is a driving factor is motivation. E.g. examples of people starting gym in January, or people that fail to loose weight.</p>

<p>The key to maintain motivation is to increase the reasons to keep practicing, and decrease the reasons to stop practicing.</p>

<p>Authors suggest to set aside one uninterrupted hour for focused practice every day. One should design theirs daily schedule so that there’s little chance that other things will take precedence over that hour.</p>

<p>E.g. the violin players who tried to practice as soon as they woke up.</p>

<p>Other important things to reduce the chances of stopping to practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Staying healthy and exercise.</li>
<li>Getting enough sleep.</li>
<li>Keeping the practice session within the hour. If one wants to practice more, take a break first .</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as working on minimizing the reasons to quit, it’s important to work on the reasons to keep practicing. On this front:</p>

<ul>
<li>Innate desire to gain a skill can drive the initial practice focus; then</li>
<li>The fact of having such skill, seeing progress, acknowledgement from other people, become a powerful drive.</li>
<li>The idea that one can be a top perfromer is also a powerful motivation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parents play an important role in motivating youths, in particular  after an event such as sickness or injury that sets them back.</p>

<p>A useful trick is to say “yes you can quit, but only after you’ll have caught back with the level of performance you had before”. Most often they won’t quit.</p>

<p>Social motivation is also very powerful. It can be leveraged to keep putting in the hours of practice. See Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s group of intellectual, and meetups and mastermind groups.</p>

<p>Deliberate Practice is at the end of the day a solitary activity though. It’s important to devise techniques to keep motivation when working solo.</p>

<p>An effective one is to define levels, decopmosing the skill in progressive achieveable grades. This way we can motivate ourselves by seeing the progress on these levels.</p>

<p>If the chuncking is right it can also be a measure of performance,  pace of improvements, and help identifying areas where to focus next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Deliberate practice can open the door to your dreams.</em>&ldquo;</p>

<h2 id="the-road-to-excellency">The Road to Excellency</h2>

<p>It usually takes at least 10 years to get to the expert performer.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-starting-out">Step 1: Starting Out</h3>

<p>One usually starts as a child. The best way to get children interested in something is to make it fun and playful.</p>

<p>It’s crucial for parents to teach children the values of self discipline, hard work, and achievement.</p>

<p>Parents should acknowledge the achievements of the children.</p>

<p>Competition with older siblings is a common in the upbringing of top performers. As well as inspiration from them. It also seems like the <em>youngest</em> sibling ends up being the most successful.</p>

<p>Parents of top mathematicians and intellectuals took a different path then sport experts&rsquo;. They seemed focus on fostering curiosity and learning. Great importance was given to reading, building models, and experimenting.</p>

<p>When children develop a true interest for a discipline and stop seeing it as a game, they are ready for the next stage.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2-becoming-serious">Stage 2: Becoming Serious</h3>

<p>At this point two things are needed: a teacher, and motivation.</p>

<p>Parents and teachers play an important role when it comes to the initial motivation.</p>

<p>They need to find ways to keep the activity of practicing, which is now more like work than play, interesting.</p>

<p>A technique for this is finding related activities that the child enjoys, and use those as motivators. E.g. If a child enjoys playing in fornt of people, then practicing is a way to get to do it more and better.</p>

<p>It is also important to foster the development of mental representations. E.g. the way chess pieces are organized, or the strategy behind a baseball game.</p>

<p>For all this to be effective though, the child needs to have a real interest in the activity.</p>

<p>If all these factors are in play, with parents and teachers making the most of the, the child will internalize the motivation. They will  need less pushing from teachers and parents.</p>

<p>In such cases the child would already be on the way to become a serious performer, and most likely need to seek a better teacher or coach.</p>

<p>Children will end up identifying themselves with their skills. They’ll see themselves more like a swimmer who goes to high school, than an high school kid doing swimming.</p>

<h3 id="stage-3-commitment">Stage 3: Commitment</h3>

<p>Once a child has reached a certain mastery of a discipline, they’re ready to take the next step and commit to becoming top performer.</p>

<p>This will usually require finding an elite coach or teacher, or even vo to a dedicated academy.</p>

<p>At this stage the motivation is completely internal, but family still plays and inportant support role, also from the financial point of virw.</p>

<h3 id="stage-4-pathbreakers">Stage 4: Pathbreakers</h3>

<p>Once a person, most likely not a child anymore, has reached the level of top performer, there are chances they’ll go onto the next step. They could become the pathbreaker or pathfinders of their field, those individual that make revolutionary contributions and</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-qi-vs-talent-vs-practice">Conclusion: QI vs Talent vs Practice</h2>

<p>In final part of the book the authors circle back on the topic of innate talent and intelligence, and their actual contribution to reaching the top performance.</p>

<p>A few historical figures generally thought as talented are debunked, showing how that was actually hard practice.</p>

<p>The book closes with an example of the results that applying Deliberate Practice to education can bring.</p>

<hr />

<p>I really enjoyed this book. I&rsquo;ll have to sit back with a paper version of it in a few months to revisit some parts and concepts.</p>
