          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The podcast <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea">Developer Tea</a> recently released a two part series on deliberate
practice (<a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/45636">part 1</a> and <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/45637">part 2</a>).</p>

<p>I first read about deliberate practice in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124">So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore
You</a>&rdquo; by Cal
Newport.</p>

<p>The concept is very attractive, and it has been proven very effective for
athletes and musicians. But how can I build a deliberate practice strategy for
my software development skills?</p>

<p>Does it even make sense?</p>

<p>It probably does, but only for a subset of things I guess. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vim/Emacs skills</li>
<li>Refactoring techniques</li>
<li>Using patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>I thinks all those are valuable, I myself am very serious about touch-typing
and shaving off keystrokes from my Vim workflows, but do they really make you a
<em>better</em> developer?</p>

<p>I think the real skills that a software developer should hone are problem
solving and the ability to learn new things.</p>

<p>That is why I guess I am less interested into deliberate practice as a way to
write code faster, but more as way to improve these <em>lower level</em> skills.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a recipe for deliberately practicing problem solving or learning.
At the moment these are only two guidelines I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to solve a little logic puzzle every day</li>
<li>When choosing a book to read, a new programming language or framework, anything new to learn, choose things that will grow your <em>area of knowledge</em></li>
</ul>
